<body>
    <h1>Front-End Technologies</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML/CSS</dt>
        <dd>These are the fundamental building blocks of web pages. HTML (Hypertext Markup
            Language) is used for structuring content, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and
            layout.
        </dd>

        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>he primary programming language for client-side web development. JavaScript allows for interactive and
            dynamic web applications. Popular libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js are often used to
            streamline front-end development.</dd>

        <dt>Front-End Build Tools:</dt>
        <dd>Build tools like Webpack, Babel, and task runners like Gulp or Grunt help automate tasks like bundling,
            transpiling, and optimizing code.
        </dd>

        <dt>Responsive Design:</dt>
        <dd>
            Knowledge of responsive design techniques and frameworks like Bootstrap for creating mobile-friendly web
            interfaces.
        </dd>

        <dt>Web Accessibility:</dt>
        <dd>
            Ensuring web applications are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, following the Web
            Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
        </dd>

        <dt>API Consumption:</dt>
        <dd>Fetching and working with data from APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to integrate external services
            and data into the front-end.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h1>Back-End Technologies</h1>

    <dl>
        <dt>
            Server-Side Programming Languages:
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Popular choices include Node.js (JavaScript), Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, and Go. The choice of language often
            depends on project requirements and developer expertise.
        </dd>

        <dt>Web Frameworks: </dt>
        <dd>Frameworks like Express.js (for Node.js), Ruby on Rails, Django (for Python), Spring Boot (for Java), and
            Laravel (for PHP) provide a structured way to build web applications.
        </dd>

        <dt>Databases:</dt>
        <dd>
            Knowledge of relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Understanding of
            database design, querying, and optimization is crucial.
        </dd>
        <dt>API development:</dt>
        <dd>
            Creating RESTful or GraphQL APIs to serve data to the front-end and other services.
        </dd>

        <dt>Server Management:</dt>
        <dd>
            Knowledge of server management, deployment, and scaling using tools like Docker and cloud platforms like
            AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
        </dd>
